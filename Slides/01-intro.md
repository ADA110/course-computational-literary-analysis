# But why? 

## Why learn computational literary analysis? 

Hello subsection 

## Why literature? 

 - Text analysis is general-purpose. So...
 - Literature presents the greatest complexities of language. 
 - If you can understand literary language, you can understand any language. 
 - Also, literature is awesome. 
 
# Prerequisites

## No prerequisites

- Some people think that the prerequisite for learning to code is already knowing how to code. 
- But programming is like explaining how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to a four-year-old.
