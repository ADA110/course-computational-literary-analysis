# Final Projects

This folder contains those final projects which students of this course chose to make public. 

## Instructions

Students, to submit your final project to the course repository, please [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on GitHub with your changes. This is totally optional. There's a lot of specialized terminology surrounding Git and GitHub, so you may have to do some reading to work it all out. However, you're not alone! Feel free to ask in our Zulip chat if you have any questions along the way.
