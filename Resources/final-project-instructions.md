## Presentation Instructions

 - Make a four-minute video, and upload it libre.video by 19:00 UTC on Thursday, August 13th. (Noon Berkeley time.)
 - Try for one slide (or Jupyter screenfull) per minute: thus, four slides
 - Post a link to the course chat, in the #General -> Final Project Presentations. 

## Final Project Notebook Instructions

 - Final project will be due on Saturday, August 15th, by the end of the day. (Any time before Sunday in your time zone.)
 - Like the homework, it should be a single Jupyter notebook. 
 - Send it via email, to jonathan.reeve@columbia.edu
 - Word count: 1,500â€“2,500 words of Markdown prose.
   - I'll post a script that can help you count
 - Maximum of **3 figures/charts/visualizations**
   - Subfigures are OK.
 - Format: Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) file
   - make it pretty! Don't print out too much
   - make it repeatable! (Run `Restart and Run All Cells`)
 - Write good markdown!
   - in the story "The Garden Party," by Katherine Mansfield
   - in the book _The Garden Party and Other Stories_
   - don't use **emphasis formatting**
   - don't use a header except for header
 - Write good code
   - DRY: don't repeat yourself
   - Comment should be the **why** # Comment here
   - Document what you're doing
   - Functions are good!
   - Run all your cells to show your output.
   - Don't include too much output (i.e., don't print out an entire novel, or more than 50 lines at a time).
 - Research is good.
   - Great final projects are usually in dialogue with some literary critical argument(s)
   - JSTOR and Google Scholar are good starting-points for finding literary critical articles. 
 - MLA Format for Citations
   - "diamonds are forever" (Bond 132). 
   - don't have a parenthetical citation if it's obvious whom you're citing
   - make a bibliography called "Works Cited" listing all of the critical works you quote or reference. Make it the final cell in your notebook. 
   - [style.mla.org](https://style.mla.org/) describes MLA style in greater detail. 
 - Start with a prose introduction. Say what your problem is. What questions are you trying to answer? 
 - Show all your code 
 - End with a conclusion. 
 - Failure can sometimes be interesting
   
## Next Steps: **Optional**

 - Make a blog post about it? 
 - Tweet about it? 
 - Submit it to a conference? Like [DH2021](https://dh2021.adho.org/)
 - Submit it to a journal? Like [The Journal of Cultural Analytics](https://culturalanalytics.org/) 
   - Or [Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](https://academic.oup.com/dsh)
